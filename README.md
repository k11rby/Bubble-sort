I chose this algorithm because it is the easiest one to work with, and since I didn't know how to use Gardio, I wanted to pick something I was the most familiar with or what I thought would be the easiest to change if needed.
Decomposition:
-make a bubble sort algorithm 
-Show the user all the steps to the bubble sort
-show the user every time there is a new pass
-make a button for generating a new array and for sorting the array
Pattern Recognition: 
-The code will compare the initial number j and the number to the right of it, j+1. If the initial number j is greater than j+1, swap the numbers. Continue doing this until you've made it down the list
Abstraction:  
-The user is explained how bubble sort works
-through the sorting process the ui will show the user the numbers being compared and if the numbers are swapped or not
Algorithm Design:
-I didn't know how to answer this

## Steps to Run: click the generate random array button or you can make your own array, then click the sort array button
